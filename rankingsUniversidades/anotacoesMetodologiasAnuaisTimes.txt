Categorias:

Teaching: This broad category employs five separate indicators designed to provide a clear sense of the teaching and learning environment
 of each institution, from both the student and academic perspective.

Industry Income: This category is designed to cover an institution's knowledge-transfer activity. 

Citations: A university's research influence — as measured by the number of times its published work is cited by academics. This weighting
 reflects the relatively high level of confidence the global academic community has in the indicator as a proxy for research quality.

Research: As with the teaching category, the most prominent indicator in research volume, income and reputation is based on the results of
 our reputational survey.

International mix: Our final category looks at diversity on campus — a sign of how global an institution is in its outlook. The ability of
 a university to attract the very best staff from across the world is key to global success.
